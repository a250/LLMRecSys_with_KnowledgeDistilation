0. Just exp with whole train dataset 
1. Train             on 0.5 train-dataset, fine-tune on other 0.5 train-dataset (with weights freezing)
2. Train with distil on 0.5 train-dataset, fine-tune on other 0.5 train-dataset (with weights freezing)
3. Train with distil on 0.5 train-dataset, fine-tune on     whole train-dataset (with weights freezing)
 
х2, as far as for ranking and value-metric
х2, as far as for two different seed's for train splitting
